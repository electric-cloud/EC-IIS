[[CheckServerStatus]]
=== CheckServerStatus

Checks the status of the specified server.

[cols="1a,1a",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter
|Description

|Configuration name
|Provide the name of the configuration that holds connection information for the IIS server. Credentials are only used from the plugin configuration if the *Use Credentials* parameter is selected.

|Use Credentials (Deprecated)
|Indicate if credentials must be used. If selected, {PRODUCT} uses the username and password from the plugin configuration.

WARNING: This parameter has been deprecated and will be removed in the future. Credentials are used if they are provided.

|Credential
|Username and password for basic authentication.

|Link to Check For
|URL to check. If not specified, a URL is constructed from the IIS configuration.

|Expected Status
|3-digit HTTP status to wait for. Default is `200`. This can also be a regular expression (for example, `200\|201`).

|Check Unavailable
|If selected, the `server:port` is checked for availability and the URL path and status parameters are ignored. If the server is available, the procedure fails.

|Timeout
|Connection timeout. Default is `30` seconds.

|Retries
|Number of retries. This only affects connecting to server, and not the status returned by the server. Default is `1`.
|===

[[CreateAppPool]]
=== CreateAppPool

Creates an IIS application pool or updates the existed one.

[cols="1a,1a",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter
|Description

|Application pool name
|Name of the application pool to create (for example, `FirstAppPool`).

|.NET framework version
|Configures the application pool to load a specific version of the .NET Framework.

NOTE: If *No Managed Code* is selected, all ASP.NET requests will fail.

|Enable 32-bit applications
|If selected for an application pool on a 64-bit operating system, the worker processes serving the application pool run in WOW64 (Windows on Windows64) mode. In WOW64 mode, 32-bit processes load only 32-bit applications.

|Managed pipeline mode
|Configures ASP.NET to run in classic mode as an ISAPI extension or in integrated mode where managed code is integrated into the request-processing pipeline.

|Queue length
|Maximum number of requests that HTTP.sys queues for the application pool. When the queue is full, new requests receive a 503 "Service Unavailable" response.

|Start automatically
|If selected, the application pool starts on creation or when IIS starts. Starting an application pool sets this property to `True`. Stopping an application sets this property to `False`.

|Limit
|Configures the maximum percentage of CPU time (in 1/1000ths of a percent) that the worker processes in an application pool are allowed to consume over a period of time, as indicated by the *Limit Interval* parameter (`resetInterval` property). If the limit set by this parameter is exceeded, the event is written to the event log and an optional set of events can be triggered or determined by the *Limit action* parameter (action property). Setting the value to `0` disables the limiting of worker processes to a percentage of CPU time.

|Limit action
|Specifies the action to take when the specified *Limit* is exceeded.

* *NoAction:* An event log entry is generated.
* *KillW3WP:* An event log entry is generated and the application pool is shut down for the duration of the reset interval.

|Limit interval (minutes)
|Specifies the reset period, in minutes, for CPU monitoring and throttling limits on the application pool. When the number of minutes elapsed since the last process accounting reset equals the *Limit interval*, IIS resets the CPU timers for both the logging and limit intervals. Setting the value of *Limit interval* to `0` disables CPU monitoring.

|Processor affinity enabled
|If selected, the worker processes serving this application pool are forced to run on specific CPUs. This enables sufficient use of CPU caches on multiprocessor servers.

|Processor affinity mask
|Hexadecimal mask that forces the worker processes for this application pool to run on a specific CPU. If selected, a value of `0` results in an error condition.

|Identity
|Configures the application pool to run as a built-in account, such as *Network Service* (recommended), *Local Service*, or as a specific user identity.

|Idle timeout (minutes)
|Amount of time, in minutes, a worker process remains idle before it shuts down. A worker process is idle if it is not processing requests and no new requests are received.

|Load user profile
|If selected, IIS loads the user profile for the application pool identity. If not selected, IIS 6.0 behavior is used.

|Maximum worker processes
|Maximum number of worker processes permitted to service requests for the application pool. If this number is greater than `1`, the application pool is referred to as a "Web Garden".

|Ping enabled
|If selected, the worker processes serving this application pool are pinged periodically to ensure that they are still responsive. This process is called health monitoring.

|Ping maximum response time (seconds)
|Maximum time, in seconds, that a worker process is given to respond to a health monitoring ping. If the worker process does not respond, it is terminated.

|Ping period (seconds)
|Period of time, in seconds, between health monitoring pings sent to the worker processes serving this application pool.

|Shutdown time limit (seconds)
|Period of time, in seconds, a worker process is given to finish processing requests and shut down. If the worker process exceeds the shutdown time limit, it is terminated.

|Startup time limit (seconds)
|Period of time, in seconds, a worker process is given to start up and initialize. If the worker process initialization exceeds the startup time limit, it is terminated.

|Application pool process orphaning enabled
|If selected, an unresponsive worker process is abandoned (orphaned) instead of terminated. This feature can be used to debug a worker process failure.

|Orphan action executable
|Executable to run when a worker process is abandoned (orphaned). For example, `C:\dbgtools\ntsd.exe` invokes NTSD to debug a worker process failure.

|Orphan action executable parameters
|Parameters for the executable that are run when a worker process is abandoned (orphaned). For example, `-g -p %1%` is appropriate if the NTSD is the executable invoked for debugging worker process failures.

|Service unavailable response type
|
* *HttpLevel:* If the application pool is stopped, HTTP.sys returns an HTTP 503 error.
* *TcpLevel:* If the application pool is stopped, HTTP.sys resets the connection. This is useful if the load balancer recognizes one of the response types and subsequently redirects it.

|Rapid fail protection enabled
|If selected, the application pool is shut down if there are a specified number of worker process failures (Maximum failures) within a specified period (Failure interval). By default, an application pool is shut down if there are five failures in a five-minute period.

|Failure interval (minutes)
|The time interval, in minutes, during which the specified number of worker process failures (Maximum failures) must occur before the application pool is shut down by Rapid Fail Protection.

|Maximum failures
|Maximum number of worker process failures permitted before the application pool is shut down by Rapid Fail Protection.

|Shutdown executable
|Executable to run when an application pool is shut down by Rapid Fail Protection. This can be used to configure a load balancer to redirect traffic for this application to another server.

|Shutdown executable parameters
|Parameters for the executable to run when an application pool is shut down by Rapid Fail Protection.

|Disable overlapped recycle
|If selected, when the application pool recycles, the existing worker process exits before another worker process is created.

NOTE: Select this option if the worker process loads an application that does not support multiple instances.

|Disable recycling for configuration changes
|If selected, the application pool does not recycle when its configuration is changed.

|Private memory limit (KB)
|Maximum amount of private memory, in KB, that a worker process can consume before the application pool is recycled. A value of `0` means there is no limit.

|Regular time interval (minutes)
|Period of time, in minutes, after which an application pool recycles. A value of `0` means the application pool does not recycle at a regular interval.

|Request limit
|Maximum number of requests an application pool can process before it is recycled. A value of `0` means the application pool can process an unlimited number of requests.

|Specific times
|A set of specific local times, in 24-hour format, when the application pool is recycled.

|Virtual memory limit (KB)
|Maximum amount of virtual memory, in KB, that a worker process can consume before the application pool is recycled. A value of `0` means there is no limit.

|Additional parameters
|Additional parameters to pass to appcmd.exe.
